# pdfTrim
Provides a cli tool to remove all pages from pdfs that are prefixes of other pages

I have time and time again encountered a strange pdf "animation" at my university, where the animation is achieved by adding content line by line to newer pages. This tool is made to delete unnecessary pages made with this "animation"

The tool cannot understand pictures and makes comparisons only with text!
